Project Planning
1. Choosing a Project
	- It should be something you care about
	- It should solve a problem you have
	- Motivation
2. What _exactly_ are you trying to build
	- Feature List
	- User Stories
	- Wireframe
	- Organize your MVP features first
	- Then consider stretch features as verticals
3. How are you going to build that thing
	- Frontend Tech Stack
	- Backend Tech Stack
	- Frontend Routes
	- Backend/API Routes
	- ERD
	- External Data Sources (APIs/Scrapers/etc)
5. Timeline & Team Balance
	- What do you expect to have completed at what time
	- Who is reponsible for what - how will you share that knowledge among your team
