## useRef

When you need an unchanging reference to a variable or to a html element, `useRef`

## useContext

When you need to tunnel state to many components, consider `useContext` to move state down your component tree without prop threading

## React Router

For frontend routing in your application use the `react-router-dom` to add both navigation, and browser location reactivity to your frontend.

## Other React Packages

The react community is big, and very busy.  Consider adding external packages to your react applciation to get lots of functionality for very little work.
